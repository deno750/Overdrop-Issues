# Overdrop-Issues
Repo for Overdrop issues tracking

Here you can request new features and report bug fixes!

Just go to the "issues" section, search if what you asking for is already asked. If not, click on "New issue", add an appropriate 
title and write a detailed description (when possible). Mark the issue with the label "bug" if the issue is a bug report, "enhanchement"
for new features and so on...
